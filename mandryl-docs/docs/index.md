# Welcome to Mandryl!

We're a group of hobbyist AI enthusiasts who are passionate about building AI models from the ground up and experimenting with their use cases, particularly in embedded spaces.

## What are these docs?

In these docs, we'll be sharing our learnings, experiments, and insights as we build and experiment with AI models for robots. Most of this will be in the format of notebooks, accessible on Google Colab, and some will be in the format of blog posts, accessible on our website.

## Join our community!

We're based in Sydney, Australia, and we're always excited to welcome new members to our in-person meetups! You can also join our online community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/XDeS8MsmzY) to chat and connect with us.
